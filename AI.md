# AI Usage Report

This document tracks the use of AI tools in the development and enhancement of the Winnie chatbot project.

## AI Tools Used

### Claude Code (Anthropic's Claude)
- **Version**: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Usage Period**: September 2025
- **Primary Use Cases**: Code enhancement, formatting fixes, and documentation

## Enhancements Made

### A-AiAssisted Increment Implementation

#### 1. Code Quality Improvements
**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/winnie/storage/Storage.java`
- `src/main/java/winnie/ui/Cli.java`
- `src/main/java/winnie/parser/Parser.java`

**Improvements Applied**:
- **Resource Management**: Enhanced file handling with try-with-resources pattern in Storage class
  - Replaced manual file closing with automatic resource management
  - Added proper error handling for directory creation
  - Improved error reporting with line numbers for corrupted data files

- **Code Formatting**: Fixed line length violations exceeding 120 characters
  - Split long string concatenations across multiple lines
  - Improved readability while maintaining functionality

#### 2. AI-Assisted Comments
Added specific comments in enhanced code sections to document AI assistance:
```java
// AI-assisted enhancement: Improved resource management with try-with-resources
// to ensure proper file closure and better error handling.
```

## What Worked Well
- **Automated Code Analysis**: AI quickly identified formatting violations and resource management issues
- **Systematic Enhancement**: AI provided structured approach to code improvements
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI effectively identified common Java best practices that could be applied

## What Didn't Work
- **Scope Creep Prevention**: Initially attempted broader refactoring before being redirected to focus only on formatting fixes
- **Context Awareness**: Required user guidance to focus on specific types of enhancements rather than comprehensive restructuring

## Time Savings
- **Estimated Time Saved**: ~2-3 hours
  - Manual identification of all line length violations: ~30 minutes
  - Research on Java best practices for resource management: ~1 hour
  - Implementation of try-with-resources pattern: ~45 minutes
  - Error message formatting improvements: ~30 minutes
  - Documentation writing: ~30 minutes

## Observations
- AI tools are most effective when given clear, specific guidelines about the scope of changes
- Formatting and style improvements can be quickly automated with AI assistance
- AI-generated comments help track which parts of the code were enhanced with AI tools
- Resource management improvements were automatically suggested based on code analysis

## Future AI Usage Plans
- Continue using AI for code quality improvements in subsequent increments
- Leverage AI for test case generation and documentation enhancement
- Use AI assistance for identifying and implementing design patterns
